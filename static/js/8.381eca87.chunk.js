I was born and raised in Indonesia, and moved to the US at the age of ten. I have tried various activities, and ended up making a small project for myself. I am currently attending my senior year at high school (graduation 2022) in Stony Brook School. I tend to be interested in the processes of making a product such as musics, buildings, video games, companies, or food. I also enjoy cooking. Cooking relaxes me, but also gives me a sense of excitement. \n\n# Currently\n\nAt Stony Brook School, my day starts by waking up at 7:30am. The academic day goes from 8am - 3:15pm, and after that there are sports from 4pm - 5:30pm/6pm (depending on the sport). After sports, day-students goes back home and boarders have dinner from 6pm - 7pm. Then studyhall from 7:30pm - 9:15pm, and then lights-out at 11pm. As for the classes I am currently taking, they are AP Stats, AP Computer Science, AP US history, AP English literature, and Linear Algebra. Due to this, my workload would last me from the start of studyhall to 11pm -- 10pm if I\'m lucky. I spend much of my weekend doing this like making this website, playing my guitar, watching food videos, and answering my curiosities. \n\n# Some history\n\n- The first ten years of my life I lived in Indonesia. I would never miss the long dreadful traffic I frequently had to encounter on my way to school and back from school. I lived in an apartement that included a big park in its property. I made friends with other kids living in my apartment and got familliar with the staff/security guards. \n\n- Everyday, after school, I would call my friends to meet at the park: typically at 4pm and we would all go back at 6pm or 7pm. I would usually manage to gather around eight to nine people, and depending on the people who came, we would either play soccer or hide and seek tag. \n\n- At times, the rules for hide and seek tag can get a bit absurd with more people, such as adding the word "zombie" after "seek", or allowing hiding spots on specific floors: usually the ground level. When it comes to hiding in the ground floor, I would always cheat by asking the staffs to hide me in an obvious spot and mislead the seekers. From this I learned the power of having connections.\n\n- I broke my right arm at the age of 4. I learned to write with my left from this incident.\n\n- I played the piano twice a week and performed in a group playing Mamma Mia \n\n- At the age of 9 my sister lift for the US\n\n- At the age of 10 I left for the US\n\n- I moved from rented house to rented house for my first year in the US\n\n- My first year of school in the US was a private catholic school St.Bartholomew, though it had more of a public school vibe to it\n\n- At the age of 11 I went to the same school my sister left for: Rumsey Hall. I entered as a 6th grader\n\n- I played lacrosse for the very first time in 6th grade\n\n- I was the only other male border, apart from my roommate, who was in 6th grade\n\n- I found interest in hand drawing, and drew various things from story characters to pokemon\n\n- In 7th grade, I made new friends and found a place to belong in until I graduate\n\n- In 8th grade, I learned to ski for the first time \n\n- In 9th grade, I learned to snowboard, which I preferred more\n\n- The summer I turned 14, I went surfing for the first time. But my parents say that I\u2019ve done it earlier, which I don\u2019t remember\n\n- The following year, I was re-inspired to play music, so I picked up the easiest and most portable instrument: the guitar\n\n- The same year, I began to explore my curiosities and interest, landing me at music composition\n\n- At the age of 15 I began fiddling with a music compiling app, Fruity Loop. I watched youtube tutorials for the most part\n\n- At the age of 16, still exploring my curiosities, I found programming/coding.\n\n- I spent time watching YouTube videos as well as things I find on \u201cstack overflow\u201d to learn the basics -- I noticed that knowing some basics in programming could benefit in the gaming realm\n\n- I would question how phones are programmed or how autonomous can a code be\n\n- At the age of 17 I was reminded of the existence of AI and found interest in this subject\n\n- During the summer I turned 18, I joined a program \u201cDesign the Future\u201d and made an app, 2WDA, that helped wheelchair users find wheelchair accessible bathrooms. I also got an intership in Zenerate\n\n- In Zenerate, I was given a csv file of shapes. These shapes were specific to the shape of a lot, the piece of land. I was tasked to indentify the shape and label the edges as front, rear, or side.\n\n\n# Hobbies \n\n#Hobbies\n- Snowboarding\n\n- Trying new food\n\n- Playing guitar\n\n- Playing soccer\n\n- Cooking\n\n- Fishing\n\n- 3D modeling\n\n- listening to music (Lo-Fi)\n\n- Learning / experiencing new things\n\n\n',l=h.split(/\s+/).map((function(e){return e.replace(/\W/g,"")})).filter((function(e){return e.length})).length,m=function(e){var n=Object.assign({},e);return Object(o.jsx)(i.b,Object(a.a)({},n))};n.default=function(){return Object(o.jsx)(d.a,{title:"About",description:"Learn about Robin Young",children:Object(o.jsxs)("article",{className:"post markdown",id:"about",children:[Object(o.jsx)("header",{children:Object(o.jsxs)("div",{className:"title",children:[Object(o.jsx)("h2",{"data-testid":"heading",children:Object(o.jsx)(i.b,{to:"/about",children:"About Me"})}),Object(o.jsxs)("p",{children:["(in about ",l," words)"]})]})}),Object(o.jsx)(s.a,{source:h,renderers:{Link:m},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}}}]);
